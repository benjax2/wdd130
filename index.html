        <p>Hi, I'm Luan. I'm 22 years old and I come from Uruguay. I'm a programming student at BYU-Idaho. I have a family of 4: my mother Lourdes, my father Kevin and my sister Ayel√©n. 
            I have been living in Montevideo, Uruguay for about 6 months. It is the capital of Uruguay and is a city that is over 200 years old with an estimated 1.384 million people. 
            I am excited to continue learning more about web development and its advantages in the working world.</p>
