            <p>Hi, I'm Luan Rodriguez. I'm 22 years old and I come from Uruguay. I am a programming student at BYU-Idaho. I have a family of 4: my father Kevin, my mother Lourdes and my sister Ayel√©n. We are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In fact, my father has the call of Stake President, Tacuarembo Stake, Uruguay.
                <br>I served a full time mission in Curitiba, Brazil. It was an incredible 25 months of service where I learned about the Brazilian culture, met amazing people, but most of all served God and grew as a child of Him.
                <br>Since I was a child I have loved programming. I have studied about it in several courses throughout my years. I am excited to continue learning more about web development, which is new to me, and its advantages in the working world.</p>

            <p>Montevideo is the capital of Uruguay. I was born here but moved at a very young age. Six months ago I returned here and I can say that this city has a rich history and culture, which is reflected in its architecture, which combines modern buildings with historic structures. It is also reflected in its cuisine and traditions, and it is a city that is over 200 years old and is estimated to have approximately 1.384 million inhabitants.</p>
