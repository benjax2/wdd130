        <p>Hi, I'm Luan. I'm 22 years old and I come from Uruguay. I'm a programming student at BYU-Idaho. I have a family of 4: my mother Lourdes, my father Kevin and my sister Ayel√©n. 
            I am excited to continue learning more about web development and its advantages in the working world.</p>

        <p>Montevideo is the capital of Uruguay. I was born here but moved here at a very young age. Six months ago I returned here and I can say that this city has a rich history and culture, which is reflected in its architecture, which combines modern buildings with historic structures. It is also reflected in its cuisine and traditions, and it is a city that is over 200 years old and is estimated to have approximately 1.384 million inhabitants.</p>
